excerpt: 'It was previously shown that causal structure can be identified from purely observational data when the data is generated by a linear structural equation model where all idiosycratic errors have the same variance. Under that assumption, we propose a simple method which can consitently identify the causal ordering even in the high-dimensional setting where the number of considered variables is much larger than the number of observed samples.'
