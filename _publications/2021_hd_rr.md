excerpt: 'We propose a residual randomization procedure designed for robust Lasso-based inference in the high-dimensional setting. Compared to earlier work that focuses on sub-Gaussian errors, the
proposed procedure is designed to work robustly in settings that also include heavy-tailed covariates and errors. Note: An error in the statement of Theorem 2 in the ICML version has been fixed in the Arxiv Version'
