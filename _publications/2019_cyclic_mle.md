excerpt: 'General non-linear optimization procedures for calculating the MLE of Gaussian linear structural equation models often suffer poor performance when the models are non-recursive (i.e., contain feedback loops or cycles). Thus, we propose an alternative block-coordinate descent procedure in which each block update can be solved in closed form. Furthermore, we characterize the set of models for which the procedure gives a unique solution at each update.'
