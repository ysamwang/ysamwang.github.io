excerpt: 'Variational inference is a widely used alternative to MCMC due to its relative computational efficiency. However, MCMC automatically quantifies uncertainty for the estimated parameters, whereas  naively using the estimated variational distribution often underestimates uncertainty. Thus, we propose a simple bootstrap procedure which produces confidence intervals for the estimated variational parameters with valid frequentist coverage. We also show in some settings, despite the inherent model misspecification of variational procedures, a two-sample test is still valid.'
