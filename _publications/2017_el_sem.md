excerpt: 'We propose estimating the parameters of a linear SEM with dependent errors using an empirical likelihood criterion. The computationally efficient procedure we propose profiles out the covariance of the idiosyncratic errors, resulting in an estimated covariance which is always positive definite. In simulations, we see that the procedure produces estimates with lower MSE than existing procedures in certain settings when the errors are non-Gaussian.'
