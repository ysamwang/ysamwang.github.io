excerpt: 'We consider the setting where the data consist of multivariate random functions which been observed from two (possibly) distinct populations (e.g., consider EEG data from a control group and a treatment group). In many cases, the scientific question of interest involves differences in the connectivity patterns (i.e., conditional independence graph) for each population. We propose a method which directly estimates the differences and avoids seperately estimating each graph.'
