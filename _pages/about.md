I am currently a principal researcher (post-doc) at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business working with [Mladen Kolar](https://mkolar.coffeejunkies.org/). I completed my PhD in Statistics at the University of Washington under the supervision of [Mathias Drton](http://www.stat.washington.edu/~md5/Home.html). 

I enjoy thinking about problems where the goal is to discover interpretable structure which underlies the data generating process. This includes problems in the areas of causal discovery, graphical models, and mixed membership models. In many cases, the methods are tailored for the high-dimensional setting where the number of variables considered may be large when compared to the number of observed samples. My applied interests vary, but are generally social science related. 

I received my undergraduate degree in both applied math and economics at Rice University, and I worked for two years in management consulting before embarking on my PhD studies. In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, attempting to cook, riding my bike, and stressing about the Dallas Cowboys.
