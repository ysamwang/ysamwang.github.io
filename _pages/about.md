I am currently a principal researcher (post-doc) at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business working with [Mladen Kolar](https://mkolar.coffeejunkies.org/) I completed my PhD in Statistics at the University of Washington under the supervision of [Mathias Drton](http://www.stat.washington.edu/~md5/Home.html). My research interests in theory and methodology include graphical models, causal discovery, and methods for high dimensional problems; my applied interests typically lie within the social sciences.

I received undergraduate degrees in both applied math and economics at Rice University, and worked for two years in management consulting before embarking on my PhD studies.

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, attempting to cook, riding my bike, and stressing about the Dallas Cowboys.
