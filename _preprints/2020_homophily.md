excerpt: 'We test the hypothesis that the gender homophily observed in the existing scholarly corpus can be explained by the varying gender representation and collaborative norms across intellectual communities. Our analysis explicitly accounts for heterogeneity in gender representation across a very fine-grain partitioning of the scholarly landscape. Ignoring this heterogeneity would otherwise inflate the estimated effect of gender on co-authorship formation. We find that even when accounting for the heterogeneous gender representation in intellectual communities---across wide swaths of the scientific landscape---co-authorship formation is not gender blind.
